# Weekend Homework: Pub/Sub Application with Requests

## How to Run:

Clone or download and open index.html in the Public folder.  That's it!

## Description of App

Homework was intended to familiarise ourselves with accessing data from different APIs, and attempting to visualise this data in some way.

Uses MetOffice API to pull in information from different weatherstations, for simplicity for the weekend homework I have restricted the weather stations only to those in the north of England.

By selecting a weatherstation ID from the drop down the most recent 500 rainfall readings are displayed, as well as the station's location on the map.
